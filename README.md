Quick start docker compose that include Ghost blog, sqlite and MySQL database. The intention is to get a general feel of depolying Ghost in production mode, where each component (Web , App & DB) are deployed seperately. 
This supports scaling and isolate failure (if any).

The compose file will pull the latest tag of each respecitve docker images before running them. Additionally, it will also persist data generated by the containters using Docker's volume.

If you want to test out Ghost locally and just to explore its feature, you should consider installing ghost-cli instead.

```
touch docker-compose.yml # Create the file:

```

```
docker-compose up -d # Running on Docker
```
